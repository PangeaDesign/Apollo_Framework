            <p class="p--lead">Iceland is a Nordic island country of Europe located in the North Atlantic Ocean. It has a population of 332,529 and an area of 103,000 km2 (40,000 sq mi), making it the most sparsely populated country in Europe.[8] The capital and largest
                city is Reykjavík. Reykjavík and the surrounding areas in the southwest of the country are home to over two-thirds of the population.</p>
            <hr class="divider--short divider--solid">
            <p class="p--dropcap">The establishment of the Kalmar Union in 1397 united the kingdoms of Norway, Denmark, and Sweden. Iceland thus followed Norway's integration to that union and came under Danish rule, after Sweden's secession from that union in 1523. Although
                the Danish kingdom introduced Lutheranism forcefully in 1550, Iceland remained a distant semi-colonial territory in which Danish institutions and infrastructures were conspicuous by their absence.</p>

            <p>Iceland is volcanically and geologically active. The interior consists of a plateau characterised by sand and lava fields, mountains, and glaciers, while many glacial rivers flow to the sea through the lowlands. Iceland is warmed by the Gulf
                Stream and has a temperate climate, despite a high latitude just outside the Arctic Circle. Its high latitude and marine influence keep summers chilly, with most of the archipelago having a tundra climate.</p>
            <code>Testing Code Block</code>
            <p>According to the ancient manuscript Landnámabók, the settlement of Iceland began in 874 AD when the Norwegian chieftain Ingólfr Arnarson became the first permanent settler on the island.[9] In the following centuries, Norwegians, and to a
                lesser extent other Scandinavians, emigrated to Iceland, bringing with them thralls (i.e., slaves or serfs) of Gaelic origin. The island was governed as an independent commonwealth under the Althing, one of the world's oldest functioning
                egislative assemblies. Following a period of civil strife, Iceland acceded to Norwegian rule in the 13th century.</p>

            <h2>Etymology</h2>
            <p>The Sagas of Icelanders say that a Norwegian named Naddodd (or Naddador) was the first Norseman to reach Iceland, and in the Ninth Century he named it Snæland or "snow land" because it was snowing. Following Naddodd, the Swede Garðar Svavarsson
                arrived, and so the island was then called Garðarshólmur which means "Garðar’s Isle".</p>

            <blockquote>
                <cite>Then came a Viking named Flóki Vilgerðarson; his daughter drowned en route, then his livestock starved to death.</cite>
                <footer>The Saga</footer>
            </blockquote>
        </div>

        <div class="container">
            <p>The sagas say that the rather despondent Flóki climbed a mountain and saw a fjord (Ísafjörður) full of icebergs, which led him to give the island its new and present name.[17] The notion that Iceland’s Viking settlers chose that name to discourage
                oversettlement of their verdant isle is merely a myth.</p>

            <p>Ingólfr was followed by many other emigrant settlers, largely Scandinavians and their thralls, many of whom were Irish or Scottish. By 930, most arable land on the island had been claimed; the Althing, a legislative and judicial assembly,
                was initiated to regulate the Icelandic Commonwealth.</p>
            <p>Lack of arable land also served impetus to the settlement of Greenland starting in 986. The period of these early settlements coincided with the Medieval Warm Period, when temperatures were similar to those of the early 20th century.</p>
            <p>At this time, about 25% of Iceland was covered with forest, compared to 1% in the present day. Christianity was adopted by consensus around 999–1000, although Norse paganism persisted among some segments of the population for some years afterwards.</p>

            <p>Iceland is at the juncture of the North Atlantic and Arctic Oceans. The main island is entirely south of the Arctic Circle, which passes through the small Icelandic island of Grímsey off the main island's northern coast. The country lies between
                latitudes 63 and 68°N, and longitudes 25 and 13°W.</p>
            <p>Iceland is closer to continental Europe than to mainland North America; thus, the island is generally included in Europe for historical, political, cultural, geographical, and practical reasons.[52][53][54][55] Geologically, the island includes
                parts of both continental plates. The closest body of land is Greenland (290 km, 180 mi).</p>

            <h5><span>Geography</span></h5>
            <p>The closest bodies of land in Europe are the Faroe Islands (420 km, 260 mi); Jan Mayen Island (570 km, 350 mi); Shetland and the Outer Hebrides, both about 740 km (460 mi); and the Scottish mainland and Orkney, both about 750 km (470 mi).
                The mainland of Norway is about 970 km (600 mi) away.</p>
            <p>Iceland is the world's 18th largest island, and Europe's second-largest island after Great Britain. The main island is 101,826 km2 (39,315 sq mi), but the entire country is 103,000 km2 (39,768.5 sq mi) in size, of which 62.7% is tundra.</p>
